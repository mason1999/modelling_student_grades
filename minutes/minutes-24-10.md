# What we went through
went through assumptions and which plots we incoude and how we address the assumptions for our model. 

# Structure
1. goals & context. 

2. data description

3. assumptions for the full model

4. Two types of model selection (first: step function forwards and backwards, second: drop)

    i. based on all these we'll decide what will be the final model and check the assumptions for the final model

    ii. There are two poosibilities what we can do-- prediction or coefficients. 

5. Limitations?

    i. Limitations related to data set?

	ii. we don't include first or second period grades. In the paper they use first and second grade

6. Dividing up the presentation

    i. Goals and context, data description -- mason

	ii. backwards and forwards: and drop -- Elena

	iii. Assumptions for both models -- Sura

	iv. Interpretation of coefficients -- Vincent
